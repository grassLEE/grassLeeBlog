# Welcome   

**Jeffrey Graessley** is a Documentation Manager in Los Angeles, California, specializing in evidence-based report generation for the Research and Development (R&D) tax credit-- a State and Federal incentive created to help companies mitigate the high costs associated with development of new/improved technologies. Moreover, Jeffrey graduated with a BA in English literature with a minor in Technical Writing from Cal Poly Pomona.   

A major part of generating reliable reports for the R&D tax credit requires long form interviews with developers and engineers, breaking down the previous effort into smaller, component pieces.
