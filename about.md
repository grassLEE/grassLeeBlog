## Biography

Hello! My name is **Jeffrey Graessley** and I built this portfolio/blog space as a vehicle to demonstrate some of the projects I have been working on, like my bookList which serves as an index to track the novels I have read.

But first, how about a little background information on me:  

**Jeffrey Graessley** is a Documentation Manager in Los Angeles, California, specializing in evidence-based report generation for the Research and Development (R&D) tax credit-- a State and Federal incentive created to help companies mitigate the high costs associated with development of new/improved technologies. Moreover, Jeffrey graduated with a BA in English literature with a minor in Technical Writing from Cal Poly Pomona. 

A major part of generating reliable reports for the R&D tax credit requires longform interviews with developers and engineers, breaking down the previous effort into smaller, component pieces. And by virtue of those many conversations, my interest in software development grew exponentially. 

I would like to invite you to check out my various projects and associated writeups... especially my Notes_Reader project, where I programmatically generate 'notes' files for various individuals based the input value from the user. 

Lastly, an early version of my bookApp can be found here on pythonanywhere.com [bookList](http://www.grasslee.pythonanywhere.com)
