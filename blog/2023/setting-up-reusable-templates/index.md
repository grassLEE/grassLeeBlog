# Setting Up Reusable Templates:

## Template Structure
Most technical writing tasks rely on a set of formatting considerations that can often be tedious to setup, or at the very least time-consuming. That's where a template will save us invaluable time... along with future headaches, should we forget to follow the formatting requirements exactly. 

In this article, I will walk you through the steps necessary to set up a reusable template using two popular writing tools: Microsoft Word and Google Docs. 

### Writing Process
As a quick aside, although it is not recommended for sharing, the above tools are great for initial drafts before moving into a more robust editor, such as Visual Studio Code (VSC). The built-in grammar/spell-check makes for convenient revisions, including spot checks for consistency and style. Then, after moving the new content into VSC, we can easily apply our Markdown syntax. 

## Word
To start, make sure you have set up the document in alignment with your working style guide and/or similar content from other writers at the organization. 

Consider these mainstays: font, size, spacing considerations, and headers. Of course, there are other reusable text elements that can be included, just be sure to apply them to the document before saving.

Initial formatting considerations for your blank document:
Consider font/size/spacing/headers/other reusable text
Pin template to Open(folder)

Google Docs
Workaround - Template folder
Set base formatting requirement
Workflow to create new Doc
