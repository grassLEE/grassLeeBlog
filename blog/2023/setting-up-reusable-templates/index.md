# Setting Up Reusable Templates:

## Template Structure
Most technical writing tasks rely on a set of formatting considerations that can often be tedious to setup, or at the very least time-consuming. That's where a template will save us invaluable time and future headaches, should we forget to follow the formatting requirements exactly. 

In this article, I will walk you through the steps necessary to set up a reusable template using two popular writing tools: Microsoft Word and Google Docs. 

### Writing Process
As a quick aside, although it is not recommended for sharing, the above tools are great for initial drafts before moving into a more robust editor, such as Visual Studio Code (VSC). The built-in grammar/spell-check makes for convenient revisions, including spot checks for consistency and style. Then, after moving the new content into VSC, we can easily apply our Markdown syntax. 

## Word - for Windows
To start, make sure you have set up the document in alignment with your working style guide and/or similar content from other writers at the organization. 

Consider these mainstays: font, size, spacing, and headers. There are other reusable text elements that can be included-- just be sure to apply them to the document before saving.

Once the document is ready, all we have to do is click 'Save As' and then change the format option to Word Template, which is denoted with the **.dotx** type. Make sure to give the template a descriptive name, a great practice for reusability, and we are all set! 

To use the document, we simply select our template from the open(new) option and select the template. Note, if the file is not present, click the adjacent tab labeled 'Recent' and you will see the most recent option available. 

## Google Docs
Google Docs has a few options depending on our account type. However, the most basic (free) option does not allow for direct template saving. 

### However, we have a simple work around available: 
- First, create a a new folder named 'Templates.' Within this folder we are then going to create a single Google Doc.  
- Next, repeat the same process as found in the [Word - for Windows](#word---for-windows) section. 
- Afterwards, save the new Google Doc and close it. Now, rather than opening the file, right click on it, and select 'Make a Copy'.
- Finally, the file copy generates in our Template folder. Right click on it again and select 'Organize > Move'. Then just select the destination location and begin drafting!


Although it can seem like a burden to set up, the time saved when generating new content remains invaluable. Plus, now we no longer have to fret over pesky formatting issues. Instead we can just focus on the fun part... WRITING!
