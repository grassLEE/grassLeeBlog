# Getting Started with Technical Writing

I'm sure you are well aware of the amazing opportunities available through technical writing, so I won't spend a lot of time going over this ever expanding field. However, if you would like to learn a bit more about potential roles, the purpose of technical documents, and other helpful tips, clink [here](https://idratherbewriting.com/) for a rich repository of information.  

### Tools:

Every organization will utilize a range of tools to effectively document their content. These tools can range from common what you see is what you get ("WYSIWYG") programs like Microsoft Word or Google Docs to more robust platforms, such as [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) or [OxygenXML](https://www.oxygenxml.com/).  

These are but a few examples from dozens, if not hundreds, of widely used options. Of course, it's impossible to become a power-user in all of them, but a working knowledge of their basic functions is often expected.  
It's a fair assumption that most people are familiar with the common WYSIWYG platforms, but if this is not the case, log into Google (or create an account, they are FREE!), and follow this quick-start [tutorial](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/7068618?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&oco=0). Make sure to familiarize yourself with the basic commands to properly format, save, and share your content.  
The last two entries (iA Writer and OxygenXML) demonstrate some of the more advanced principles of technical writing, i.e. **structured writing**. These tools leverage a light markup language, as in the case with iA Writer, and modular, component based writing, found with OxygenXML.  
We'll spend a bit more time with that concept and its far reaching potential a little later, but for now let's focus on something more manageable.
