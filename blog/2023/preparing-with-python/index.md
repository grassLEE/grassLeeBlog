# Preparing with Python: Formatting Lists between Common Apps

Python is a versatile tool capable of automating a great deal of our daily tasks, from programmatically changing filenames, to sorting datasets by entry value, and a great deal in between. These tools are available to even the most green of beginners, so there is no need to feel intimidated.  

Let’s explore a common data entry task and see how Python can simplify the process. Consider an Excel Spreadsheet just like this one below:  

You’ll notice the highlighted column features a long list of names. Now, if we wanted to extract that information, we could just copy/paste the data into a Word doc and call it a day. However, that option is quite limiting in terms of formatting and modularity. This can become further complicated if our example list features several duplicate values. 

## Example Excel Spreadsheet  
Say we have an Excel Spreadsheet that looks something like this:
